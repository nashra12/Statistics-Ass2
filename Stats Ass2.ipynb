    "Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "Ans-> The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Median: The middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the set has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mode: The number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. A set can have more than one mode if multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n",
    "    The mean is used when the data is symmetrically distributed without outliers, as it considers all values in the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Median: The middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the set has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "    The median is used when the data is skewed or contains outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mode: The number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. A set can have more than one mode if multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency. The mode is used for categorical data or when identifying the most common value is important. It is useful in understanding the most frequent occurrence in the data.\n",
